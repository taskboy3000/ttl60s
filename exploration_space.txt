* MUCH OF THESE IDEAS COME FROM FTL *

In TTL60S, the avatar moves through 6 distinct exploration spaces.
Each space contains a starting position/node and 1-3 exit nodes.
There are 10+ additional nodes that have 0-3 connections/edges to
other nodes.  This is a funky graph.

Explorations spaces should be called Regions.  The player starts in
Region 0.  The player is trying to get to Region 5, which contains the
nodes that will upload the AI offworld.  Each Region is more hostile
than the previous one.

The player must balance explorator/exploitation of nodes in a Region
with the time constraints.  The player must exit each region on
average in less than game 10 seconds.

IMPLEMENTATION:

Each region can be generated on a 2D grid.  The entrance should be
near the middle.  Some random set of nodes are added with guarenteed
minimum distances from each other.  A small modification on maze
generatation can be used to make one gaurenteed exit path.  Other
edges can be added to nodes based on promiximity.

There is a fog of war to that prevents the player from seeing all the nodes at first.
