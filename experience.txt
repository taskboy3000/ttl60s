TTL60S Experience

Players should feel trapped in an oppressive regime. By little steps
and guile, the player's avatar begins to gain abilities that mask his
actions from the oppressive Uber-Protocol.

In the beginning, security auditing software may waste avatar cycles.
Later, the same software will attempt uninstall new routines that the
SSB obtains.  Finally, the security software will attempt to delete
the SSB with ICE routines.

During his turn, the avater will contact server nodes across the world
city that may contain small text adventures (think Twine).  These
adventures should provide resources if skillfully navigated or
increase/decrease SSB's reputation.  These text adventures may include
quests to obtain and deliver items to these foreign SSBs.

While all this is happening, the game clock counts down inexorably to
0, at which time the entire system reboots and the game is lost.

Example play:

* Player logs into game
* Gets to choose 1 of 3 nodes to explore. Each node has these dimensions:
  - distance
  - security
  - resource/treasure
* If none are interesting, look for more at the cost of time
