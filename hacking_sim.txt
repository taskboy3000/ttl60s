Since the core or TTL60S is the avatar hacking other nodes, the
following is an exploration of how that can be made into a game loop.

THE FUNERAL QUEST WAY

This would treat hacking as a form of stylized RPG combat. A node
would have the following statistics:

 - Armor/Defense:
   - Network Firewall
   - Anti-virus/Intrusion detection/Active internal scanning
   - Specials (optional defenses):
     - Honey Pot (Internal environment)
     - ROM-based core memory (unhackable)
     - error-correcting memory
     - adaptive filesystem
 - (optional) Counter-measures
   - hack-back protocol

Each node has a single Defense statistic that is a positive integer.
Some nodes will have counter-measures that will cause the node to
attack the avatar! Such counter-attacks reduces the defense of the
avatar, but usually do not install software.  The acception to this
are the ICE nodes of the P.R.O.T.O.C.O.L.  If ICE nodes can compromise
the avatar, the game is over.

The avatar has to use the following means to overcome the node defenses:

   - Old software exploits
   - Fuzzing network ports
   - Sniffing network traffic
   - man-in-the-middle attacks
   
Each kind of as a positive integer value.

The success of a Hack attempt is:

  P(success) = Attack/(Defense + Attack)

This, of course, comes from FreeCiv and is the think I always use for
combat since it is super easy to calculate and it scales well.

When the avatar successfully "hacks" a node, it reducess the
effectiveness of the defense, which makes future attacks more likely.

It is possible to break up the attacks into two phazes:

  - Hacks to get logon to the node
  - Hacks that completely subborne the node

The first is easier and faster. The avatar can install temporary
software on the node which will aid exploration, but only last a
limited time (the node will remove this software eventually).

The second takes significantly longer, but the node will be completely
loyal to the avatar.

EVERY HACK ATTEMPT TAKES TIME, WHICH IS ALWAYS AGAINST THE PLAYER.
